Hi Max,

Thanks for reaching out.

As it stands, the visual appearance of your app is fine, and as long as y=
ou don't use our brand or suggest any affiliation you shouldn't violate o=
ur guidelines. We would very much prefer that you didn't name your projec=
t "S10ck" (which is close enough to Slack that it might confuse people), =
but it's fine if you want to describe your project as "similar to Slack",=
 a "Slack clone" or "Slack-adjacent".

Adding a disclaimer stating that your product is not created by, affiliat=
ed with, or supported by Slack Technologies, Inc. would also be appreciat=
ed.

I encourage you to review our Terms of Service (https://slack.com/terms-o=
f-service) as you continue to develop your app, and good luck with your c=
ontest!

Best,
Jeremy =
